Using WPF to input glucose readings - add to a database - and create output data

Idea being that Health care professionals need to have access to each patients glucose monitor to download/review readings. Concept would be to create an environment that would allow patients to download from meter/input manually (perhaps via mobile app) and upload the data.

Obviously need to take into acccount security and access.
